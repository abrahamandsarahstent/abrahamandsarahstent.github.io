Abraham & Sarah’s Tent is a welcoming and inclusive online community for progressive Jews (or those exploring their relationship with Judaism) in the U.K. and around the world to create a sense of community and support one another. 

Rabbi Judith Levitt and her team lead services, adult education, B’nei Mitzvah tutoring and pastoral care, as well as so much more.

We aim to create spaces which are especially welcoming if you are shielding or otherwise still COVID-cautious, housebound, elderly, unwell, disabled, neurodiverse, LGBTQI+, can’t access a physical building to engage in Jewish life, or otherwise don’t feel you have a place in mainstream Judaism. However, if none of these apply and you’d just like to join us because we’re awesome, we would love to have you! You. Are. Welcome.

If you'd like to know more, you can [access our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/557302445794217), or [visit Rabbi Judith's Linktree](https://linktr.ee/rabbijudith). When registration links for upcoming events are available, we will post them to this page.
