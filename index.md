Abraham & Sarah’s Tent is a welcoming inclusive online community for progressive Jews (or those exploring their relationship with Judaism) in the U.K. & around the world to create a sense of community & support one another. 

Rabbi Judith Levitt & her team will lead services, adult education, B’nei Mitzvah Tutoring & pastoral care as well as so much more.

Especially welcoming for those who are shielding, are housebound, elderly, have COVID, are disabled, are neurodiverse, are LGBTQI+ & so many more who can’t access a physical building for your Jewish life, you don’t feel you have a place in mainstream Judaism or you’d just like to join us because we’re awesome!! You. Are. Welcome.
