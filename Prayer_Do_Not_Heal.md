A Prayer for Those Who Do Not Heal

Eternal God, You created each of us in your image. We pray for all those whose struggles are ongoing. We pray for those with chronic health conditions and for those with disabilities. We pray for those who seek healing and those who seek understanding. We pray for those whose bodies and minds will not heal. Give them strength and resilience. We are still whole in your eyes. 

We pray for:
Strength to withstand pain
Patience to endure fatigue 
Courage to live in a society not formed for diverse needs. 
Understanding from loved ones
Respect from strangers 
We pray for wisdom & trust from medical professionals 
We pray able bodied community enact their Holy values.
Eternal God, please be a place of solace for us in moments of struggle. Help us remember that we can turn to You & towards community. May we always recognise that we are created perfectly as we are. 




Blessed are you Eternal God who creates us in your Divine image.
