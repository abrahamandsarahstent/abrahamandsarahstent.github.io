Our next event is a Pesach Seder to be held jointly with the Honeycomb project:

This is a message from student Rabbi Eleanor Davis who is organising it:
 
 "Members of Abraham and Sarah's Tent are warmly invited to join me for an online Seder with other people on Jewish journeys: an evening of real ritual that's also a safe and inclusive learning space.  It's a long evening, so you're welcome to dip out and rejoin as needed - open minds and open doors (not only for Elijah) are the order of the day, with plenty of interaction.  The Seder is free to join; you just need to sign up via the link.  I'd love you to be part of our community for the evening!‚Äù

"More than four questions: an Online Seder for all who are curious!
"Explaining Judaism to others while still on your own learning journey can be challenging: at this friendly, relaxed Pesach (Passover) Seder we'll both celebrate and demystify perhaps the most famous Jewish festival ritual, with explanations of its details and opportunities for all to ask questions.
"If you recently converted or are in the process of converting via Reform Judaism or Liberal Judaism, you and your non-Jewish family are invited to join us online on Monday 22 April 2024. Bring your own dinner; a pdf Haggadah and guide to the evening will be emailed ahead of the Seder.
